    <h3>Responsive Redesign: Online Voting Information</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project was to work through all steps of redesigning a website, from identifying usability issues through developing a responsive website. I learned the importance of each step of the redesign process and used Bootstrap for the first time! This project was an exciting opportunity to apply what I have learned in class to a website in my local community.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-plain">
    <h1>Chosen Website</h1>
    <p>The website I chose is the elections page of my hometown's government website. With the upcoming election and the COVID-19 pandemic, I thought it would be especially important that voting information is easy to find online. I remembered my difficulties finding information about how to vote early in my hometown and decided that this would be the perfect website to redesign. 

      <br><br>Below is a screenshot of the desktop view. Visit the page <a href="http://www.newtonma.gov/gov/elections/default.asp">here</a> and scroll to understand the usability problems.

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Finding Problems</h1>
    <h2>Usability</h2>
      <p>After choosing my website, I analyzed its usability and found a few problems which I have outlined below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Usability</b> - a nearly effortless understanding of the architecture and navigation of the site</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Not intuitive that the top four buttons will link to external website</li>
            <li>Inconsistent information hierarchy and header style</li>
            <li>Poor information architecture and unclear what is emphasized</li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Learnability</b> - how fast a user who has never seen the user interface before can accomplish basic tasks</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Repeated information on different parts of the website makes it hard to know where to go</li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Memorability</b> - after visiting the site, if a user can remember enough to use it effectively in future visits</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Other than the four main buttons, there is an overwhelming amount of text which makes it hard to remember exactly what is on the page and where it is</li>
            <li>Many side navigation buttons makes it hard to remember how to get to information again</li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Efficiency</b> - How fast an experienced user can accomplish tasks</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Long scroll makes it hard to find desired information</li>
            <li>Even someone experienced would most likely have to use a command F function or scroll for a while</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Next I analyzed the website from an accessibility framework. I used the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/"><b>WebAIM Wave tool</b></a> and the built in Mac screenreader tool (Voiceover). The accessibility problems I found are laid out below</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Contrast issues</b> - light green text color on white background</li>
        <li><b>Missing elements</b> - lacking alternative text for images, empty headers, and empty links</li>
        <li><b>Poor structure/hierarchy</b> - using headers is not just for visual appeal, but also an accessibility issue</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Because this page has almost no headers used in the text body of the page it was very difficult to navigate using the screen reader which relies on cues from the html</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      
  </div>

  <div class="section-plain">
    <h1>Lo-fi Wireframes</h1>
    <p>I started the redesign process by creating lo-fi wireframes in Balsamiq that addressed the key usability issues outlined above. My solution was driven by three main principles.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Simplicity</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting rid of the side nav bar</li>
          <li>Only include important voting information</li>
          <li>Get rid of repeated information</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Efficiency</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Condense long scroll text into buttons that will link out to subpages</li>
          <li>Make the page easier to navigate and accomplish tasks quickly</li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Consistency</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop consistent headers, subheadings, and information architecture</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>These changes are annotated on my lo-fi wireframes below. I created a wireframe for each device size to demonstrate responsiveness.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Hi-fi Prototypes</h1>
    <p>I built on my lo-fi wireframes by creating hi-fi prototype in Adobe XD. Again I made a prototype for each device to demonstrate responsiveness.
      <br><br>I annotated the prototypes with important html elements to show how I planned to build the responsive functionality. I used bootstrap to develop so some functionality is built in, but I tried to highlight how the site changes across each device.

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section-plain">
    <h1>Visual Design Style Guide</h1>
    <p>Next I created a visual design style guide that includes the important style elements for the redesign. This documents consistency of elements on the site and lays out important elements for developing the site. Icons are sourced from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> and logo is sourced from the Newton MA website.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Responsive Site</h1>
    <p>Finally, I put it all together and built a responsive version of this page! Check it out <a href="https://immense-brushlands-37972.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-plain">
    <h1>Takeaways</h1>
    <p>Reliable and clear voting information is more important than ever and although the existing site was completely funtional, it could have been better designed for efficiency and memorability. I learned a lot about the design/redesign process and gained new skills in working with prototpying softwares as well as developing more complex front end websites.</p>
